Hapi Login

##Description

##Getting Started
You will need to first clone or fork this repo. Afterwards, head to [mongolab.com](mongolab.com) and sign up for a free account. You will need to setup a free-tier database with appropriate db user and db password. Note that the db user and db password are not the same as the one used to log into MongoLab.

Once you have done that you will then duplicate the `config.example.js` file and rename it to `config.js.` Inside that file, please fill in all corresponding information. Rest assured that the config file will be ignored when you commit onto Github/Bitbucket.

If you have not done this already, I would install nodemon. It is an awesome tool that automatically restarts the terminal console after each save. nodemon should be installed globally through `npm i -g nodemon`

```
git clone git@github.com:masterfung/hapi-login.git
cd hapi-login
npm install
npm start
```
